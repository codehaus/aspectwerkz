                This is a brief outline of the main concepts in the
                <code>AspectWerkz</code> framework and how they are used.

                You most likely
                <b>not</b> learn Aspect-Oriented Programming
                by only reading this paper. If you are a beginner I would
                recommend that you first read some introductory articles on the
                subject.
