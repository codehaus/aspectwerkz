                        Amont many other things this release is shipped with a completely new pointcut grammar which is much more
                        expressive and powerful, and rich annotation support for both typed and untyped annotations.
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                                application (
                                <code>WEB-INF/aop.xml</code>,
                                <code>META-INF/aop.xml</code>) and have them following

                                One single API to access both JavaDoc-style and Java 1.5 annotations, allows using them
                                together seamlessly.

                                Typed and untyped annotations for JavaDoc-style annotations.
                                Supports the same parameters types as Java 1.5 annotations and has strongly
                                typed compile time checking (using a new annotation compiler).

                                expression as "parameter" and can be used to build arbitrary nested expressions.

                                and has slightly different options, so to compile the aspects use

                                are very expensive to match. Those are deactivated by default. If your system uses those handler pointcuts, you have to
                                add the
                                <code>-Daspectwerkz.handler.pointcut=true</code> JVM option when starting up your JVM.

                        In this release is mainly a bug-fix release, but we have added some new functionality
                        (and changed some APIs) as well:

                                <code>Aspect</code> base class anymore, but
                                can be any Java class and extend anything they like.

                                Retrieval of information about the system, adding and reading of parameters and metadata etc. is
                                done through the
                                <code>CrossCuttingInfo</code> class. An aspect or mixin that is
                                interested in accessing this info should have a constructor that takes a
                                <code>CrossCuttingInfo</code> instance as its only parameter.

                    <p>
                        AspectWerkz has gone through a lot of changes, the whole core engine has
                        for example been thrown out and replaced by a much more flexible and
                        performant one.  The join point model is much more expressive and
                        orthogonal we have also implemented a JIT compiler that is making
                        AspectWerkz much more performant.  On top of that we have a new
                        implementation of true runtime weaving, which allows you to redefine
                        your aspect model including adding
                        <b>new</b> pointcuts at runtime.

                    <p>
                        We will not list all new features here, see the

                        for details. But the main new features are these:

                        <p>
                            We have improved the expressiveness and orthogonality a lot.

                        <p>
                            AspectWerkz currently supports the following join points:

                                <li>

                        <p>
                            In the latest version we have reached a high level of orthogonality:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    All advice types (around, after and before) works with all poincut
                                    designators (except for the handler pointcut which is only possible to
                                    bind to the before advice).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    You can compose new pointcuts by mixing any types of pointcuts.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            The syntax has changed slightly, both in the XML and annotation definition. However not more than that the migration should be fairly easy. See the
                            <a href="http://aspectwerkz.codehaus.org/">docs</a> for details on the new syntax.

                    <subsection name="Performance improvements and JIT compilation">
                        <p>
                        We have implemented a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler that detects advice chains that are often
                        executed and generates a custom class on the fly that invokes the advice chain
                        and the target join point statically.

                    <subsection name="Runtime weaving">
                        <p>
                        In addition to the capabilities to rearrange aspects and advices at existing
                        join points and swapping mixin implementation
                        at runtime, we provide a unique feature of adding new pointcuts at runtime
                        without any prior knowledge.
                        The implementation is based on Java HotSwap and thus requires a compliant
                        JVM.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        A simple API allows to refine the aspect definition to add new pointcuts
                        and then trigger the activation of it.  Prior to pointcuts addition,
                        your programs are guaranteed to run without any overhead since the
                        bytecode does not gets modified prior activation. Moreover the runtime
                        weaving does not require to have a remote JVM to control the HotSwap
                        API since we provide a dedicated in-process module.

                            The runtime annotations tags have changed. (They now have
                            an aspectwerkz namespace and are using the same syntax as XDoclet.)

                            Completely new definition model. Aspects, advices,
                            introductions and pointcuts are now completely orthogonal
                            and the model now has the essence of the AspectJ model.
                            See the documentation for details.
                        </li>

                            (e.g.
                            <code>((pc1 OR pc2) AND !pc3)</code> and similar).

                        <li>
                            setField and getField now works for get and set java.util.*
                            collection fields (e.g. add/get/remove/size and so on).

                        <li>
                            Advice and introduction container is now pluggable. I.e. the
                            user can provide its own custom implementation (f.e. to enable
                            persistence).

                            Caller side pointcuts. I.e. the possibility to advise a
                            method invocation (caller side) apart from method
                            execution (callee side).

                            Fine-grained pattern language for picking out pointcuts.
                            It is now possible to pick out method pointcuts by method name,
                            parameter types and return type as well as field pointcuts
                            by field name and field type. All these support regular
                            expressions.

                            Runtime attributes for advices (method/field/throws).
                            I.e. add meta-data to your methods/field/classes as
                            JavaDoc tags which are picked up by the weaver and
                            used as rule set when doing the transformations.
