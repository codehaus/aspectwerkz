                            <li>
                                More expressive <code>cflow</code> pointcuts that can take any pointcut
                                expression as "parameter" and can be used to build arbitrary expressions

                <subsection name="New features and changes in release 0.10">
                    <p>
                        This release is mainly a bug-fix release. Refer to release note of 0.10.RC2 and 0.10.RC1 for a list of new
                        features as compared to 0.9.
                        <ul>

                                A thread safe issue has been fixed in the join point execution model.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                IBM JRE support has been fixed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Unix/Linux comamnd line scripts has been fixed (was missing bcel.jar).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Exception throwned by method of weaved classes are not wrapped anymore. Exception throwned
                                by mixin implementation are not wrapped anymore.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                JIT <code>JoinPoint</code> compilation is now thread safe.
                            </li>

                                <code>serialVersionUID</code> computation fixed.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Due to a lack of <code>within</code> expression support in the pointcut grammar (addressed in 1.0), the handler pointcut
                                are very expensive to match. Those are deactivated by default. If your system uses those handler pointcuts, you have to
                                add the <code>-Daspectwerkz.handler.pointcut=true</code> JVM option when starting up your JVM.

                <subsection name="New features and changes in release 0.10RC2">

                    <p>
                        In this release is mainly a bug-fix release, but we have added some new functionality
                        (and changed some APIs) as well:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Aspects does not have to extend the <code>Aspect</code> base class anymore, but
                                can be any Java class and extend anything they like.
                            </li>
                            <br/>
                            <li>
                                The <code>JoinPoint</code> class has these two methods:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <code>getSignature()</code> - which is used to retrieve the static signature
                                        for the join point.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <code>getRtti()</code> - which is used to retrieve the RTTI (Runtime Type Information)
                                        about the join point.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                Both these methods returns a base interface that could be used, but is usually best
                                to cast to a more fine-grained and specific type.
                            </li>
                            <br/>
                            <li>
                                Retrieval of information about the system, adding and reading of parameters and metadata etc. is
                                done through the <code>CrossCuttingInfo</code> class. An aspect or mixin that is
                                interested in accessing this info should have a constructor that takes a
                                <code>CrossCuttingInfo</code> instance as its only parameter.
                                See the docs for details.
                            </li>
                            <br/>
                            <li>
                                Pluggable aspect container - The possibility to provide your own aspect container
                                implementation is back.
                                Useful if you need to control how your aspects are instantiated for example if you
                                want that to be handled by an IoC container (Spring, PicoContainer etc.))

                <subsection name="New features and changes in release 0.10RC1">

                    <p>
                        AspectWerkz has gone through a lot of changes, the whole core engine has
                        for example been thrown out and replaced by a much more flexible and
                        performant one.  The join point model is much more expressive and
                        orthogonal we have also implemented a JIT compiler that is making
                        AspectWerkz much more performant.  On top of that we have a new
                        implementation of true runtime weaving, which allows you to redefine
                        your aspect model including adding
                        <b>new</b> pointcuts at runtime.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We will not list all new features here, see the
                        <a href="http://aspectwerkz.codehaus.org/">docs</a>
                        for details. But the main new features are these:

                    <subsection name="Expressiveness and orthogonality">

                        <p>
                            We have improved the expressiveness and orthogonality a lot.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            AspectWerkz currently supports the following join points:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    method (static and member) execution
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    method (static and member) call
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    constructor execution
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    constructor call
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    field (static and member) modification

                                <li>
                                    field (static and member) access
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    catch clauses
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    cflow

                        <p>
                            In the latest version we have reached a high level of orthogonality:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    All advice types (around, after and before) works with all poincut
                                    designators (except for the handler pointcut which is only possible to
                                    bind to the before advice).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    You can compose new pointcuts by mixing any types of pointcuts.

                            The syntax has changed slightly, both in the XML and attribute definition. However not more than that the migration should be fairly easy. See the

                        We have implemented a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler that detects advice chains that are often
                        executed and generates a custom class on the fly that invokes the advice chain
                        and the target join point statically.

                        In addition to the capabilities to rearrange aspects and advices at existing
                        join points and swapping mixin implementation
                        at runtime, we provide a unique feature of adding new pointcuts at runtime
                        without any prior knowledge.
                        The implementation is based on Java HotSwap and thus requires a compliant
                        JVM.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        A simple API allows to refine the aspect definition to add new pointcuts
                        and then trigger the activation of it.  Prior to pointcuts addition,
                        your programs are guaranteed to run without any overhead since the
                        bytecode does not gets modified prior activation. Moreover the runtime
                        weaving does not require to have a remote JVM to control the HotSwap
                        API since we provide a dedicated in-process module.
