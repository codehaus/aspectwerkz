                This is a brief outline of the main concepts in the
                <code>AspectWerkz</code> framework and how they are used.

            <p>
                You most likely <b>not</b> learn Aspect-Oriented Programming
                by only reading this paper. If you are a beginner I would
                recommend that you first read some introductory articles on the
                subject.

                <code>AspectWerkz</code> is a dynamic, lightweight and
                high-performant AOP framework for Java. It utilizes the
                <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel">BCEL</a> library for
                bytecode manipulation of Java classes. It hooks in directly after
                the bootstrap class loader thru several state of the art options and can perform bytecode transformations
                on classes loaded by all the preceeding class loaders. The target
                classes can be regular POJOs.
