                The <code>Advice</code> class implements the advice concept,
                i.e. defines code that is executed when a join point is reached.
            </p>

            <subsection name="Implementation">
                <p>
                    There are currently four types of Advices supported:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>AroundAdvice</code> - is invoked "around" the
                            join point. Can be used to intercept method
                            invocations.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li>
                            <code>PreAdvice</code> - is invoked before the join
                            point. Can be used for advising fields or caller side
                            pointcuts.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li>
                            <code>PostAdvice</code> - is invoked after the join
                            point. Can be used for advising fields or caller side
                            pointcuts.
                        </li><br/>

                            <code>ThrowsAdvice</code> - advises join points
                            where an exception is thrown out of a method.
                        </li>

                 <p>
                    An <code>AroundAdvice</code> is implemented by extending
                    the <code>AroundAdvice</code> class and implementing the
                    abstract method <code>Object execute(final JoinPoint jp)</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note: An <code>AroundAdvice</code> can <b>not</b> be used
                    with caller side or field pointcuts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is a simple example of an <code>AroundAdvice</code>.
                    (For more examples see the
                    <a href="/examples.html">Examples section</a>.)
                    <br/>
                    It is in the method <code>execute</code> that the action
                    takes place. The <code>JoinPoint</code> object that is
                    passed to the method contains metadata of the current
                    join point. To invoke the next advice in the chain (or the
                    target method if there are no more advices) simply call
                    <code>joinPoint.proceed()</code>. This method will return
                    the result from the next advice (or the target method).

                The <code>Introduction</code> class implements the concept of
                Mixins/Open Classes. I.e. an <code>Introduction</code> makes it
                possible to extend a class with a new interface and/or a new
                implementation (methods and fields).
            </p>

            <subsection name="Implementation">
                <p>
                    Both the interface and the implementation extensions are just
                    regular Java interfaces and classes. There is no need to have
                    them implement a specific interface or extend a certain class.
                    All you have to do is define them. The only rules are
                    that the introduced implementation has to implement the
                    introduced interface and have a default no-argument constructor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When defining an interface introduction you only have to specify
                    the interface, but when introducing a new implementation to a
                    class, you must specifiy both the implementation class a
                    matching interface. This is needed since if you don't specify
                    an interface that the client can cast the target object to,
                    the introduced implementation will not be accessible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note: if you add more than one <code>Introduction</code> to
                    a target class then <b>you</b> have to make shure that the
                    names of the methods does not collide (or you will get
                    strange results).
                </p>

                    When defining the introductions there are four attributes

                            each introduction needs to have a unique name that will work
                            as a handle to the advice to be used when referencing the
                            introduction in the system.

                The <code>Pointcut</code> class implements the pointcut concept.
                Pointcuts selects join points and values at those points,
                i.e. selects well-defined points in the program flow.

                    There are currently four different types of pointcuts supported:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>MethodPointcut</code> - picks out join points
                            defining method execution.
                            Valid advice for this pointcut is <code>AroundAdvice</code>.

                            defining field access or modification.
                            Valid advices for this pointcut are <code>PreAdvice</code>

                The <code>Aspect</code> class implements the aspect concept.
                Aspects are <code>AspectWerkz's</code> unit of modularity for
                crosscutting concerns. They are defined in terms of pointcuts,
                advices and introductions.
            </p>

                    <b>Abstract aspects - aspect inheritance</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have the possibility of defining abstract aspects that you
                    can reuse by letting aspects inherit the the abstract aspect using
                    the <code>extends</code> attribute. Aspect inheritance works
                    pretty much like regular class inheritance. An abstract aspect
                    is defined using the <code>abstract-aspect</code> element.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    When defining the aspects there is first one attribute
                    that needs to be specified:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>name</code> - specifies a unique name for the aspect.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li>
                            <code>extends</code> - specifies the abstract aspect that
                            the aspect extends (optional).
                        </li><br/>

                    <b>Adding the pointcuts definitions</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the aspect definition you put the pointcut definitions (see the
                    <a href="#Pointcuts">Pointcuts section</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Adding the introductions</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then you specify the introductions that you want to define
                    in this <code>aspect</code>. This is done using the
                    <code>introduction</code> element. You can also use the element
                    <code>introduce</code> if you find it more intuitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This element has an attribute <code>class</code> where you define
                    the pattern for the classes that you want to be applied by this/these
                    introductions. Within this element you define the references to the introductions.
                    Using the <code>introduction-ref</code> element:
                    <code>&lt;introduction-ref name="nameOfIntroduction"/&gt;</code>
               </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Adding the advices</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You also define which advices should be applied to which pointcuts.
                    This is done using the <code>advice</code> element. You can also use
                    the element <code>advise</code> if you find it more intuitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code>advice</code> element has an attribute called <code>expression</code>
                    (<code>pointcut</code> works fine as well) in which you can define an expression
                    based on the names of the pointcuts you have defined for this aspect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This expression can be any (almost) kind of algebraic expression.
                    The only difference is that you have to use <code>OR</code> instead
                    of <code>||</code> and <code>AND</code> instead of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>
                    (lowercase works fine as well). AND is needed because it is cumbersome
                    to write &amp;&amp; in XML (needs to be escaped) and OR is used to make
                    it coherent;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here you also define if the pointcut/expression should be a part of a
                    control flow using the <code>cflow</code> attribute. The <code>cflow</code>
                    is defined using its pointcut name.

            <p>
                The <code>JoinPoint</code> class implements the join point
                concept, i.e. a well-defined point in the program flow.
                A <code>JoinPoint</code> is picked out by a <code>Pointcut</code>.
            </p>

            <subsection name="Implementation">
                <p>
                    There are four different types of join points:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>MethodJoinPoint</code>
                        </li><br/>
                        <li>
                            <code>FieldJoinPoint</code>

                        <li>

                </p>

                <p>
                    You only have to deal with the different types of
                    join points when you in your <code>Advice</code> need to
                    cast the <code>JoinPoint</code> object to a specific type
                    to be able to retrieve meta-data from this specific join point.
                    See the JavaDoc for more information on what information is
                    available.
