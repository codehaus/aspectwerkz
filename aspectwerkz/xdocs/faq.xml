                <p>
                    <code>AspectWerkz</code> is a dynamic, lightweight and
                    high-performant AOP/AOSD framework for Java.

            <subsection name="How can I use it without starting up the application or application server with the command line tool?">
                <p>
                    You can post-process (instrument/transform) your source files before use. See the
                    <a href="/documentation.html#Startup and transformations">Startup and transformations</a>
                    section.

            <subsection name="What does the aspectwerkz command line tool do?">
                <p>
                    Basically it just invokes the normal java command line tool
                    by calling a class that intercepts the normal class loading
                    scheme before it invokes the main class specified. This means
                    that you can just substitute the normal call to:<br/>
                    <code>java -cp .. -D.. mainclass args</code> with:
                    <code>aspectwerkz -cp .. -D.. mainclass args</code>
                    and everything should work as before, the only difference
                    is that all classes that are loaded will be transformed
                    (if they are defined to). You can even hack the startup
                    script of your favorite application server and start it up
                    using the <code>aspectwerkz</code> command line tool as
                    outlined above.

            <subsection name="If I use the post-processor, I'll lose the possibility to change my configurations at runtime, right?">
                <p>
                    Actually no. You will still be able to to all the things covered in the
                    <a href="http://aspectwerkz.sourceforge.net/documentation.html#Hot deployment">Hot deployment section</a>
                    of the documentation. Like swapping the implementation of a Introduction or change the order or
                    of advices and so on. The only things you can not do are introducing <b>new</b>
                    Introductions and advise <b>new</b> methods.
