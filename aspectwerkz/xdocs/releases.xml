                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            cflow (control flow) pointcuts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Performance improvement for advices by a factor of 2.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Many, many bugfixes (introduced by the new pointcut model
                            implementation in 0.6.x).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The runtime attributes tags have changed. (They now have
                            an aspectwerkz namespace and are using the same syntax as XDoclet.)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The prefix <code>___AW_</code> is now used at all introduced methods and fields.
                            Including the <code>Identifiable.getUuid</code> method which is renamed to
                            <code>___AW_getUuid</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Documentation and examples have been updated.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Uses new version of JMangler (3.0.2) which is released under LGPL.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Completely new definition model. Aspects, advices,
                            introductions and pointcuts are now completely orthogonal
                            and the model now has the essence of the AspectJ model.
                            See the documentation for details.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Abstract aspects definitions as well as pointcut expressions
                            (e.g.
                            <code>((pc1 OR pc2) AND !pc3)</code> and similar).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Multiple weave models.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Multiple AspectWerkz system can run in the same JVM concurrently.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            setField and getField now works for get and set java.util.*
                            collection fields (e.g. add/get/remove/size and so on).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Advice and introduction container is now pluggable. I.e. the
                            user can provide its own custom implementation (f.e. to enable
                            persistence).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The transparent persistence of advices and introductions have
                            been moved to the sandbox.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Many bug fixes.
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Caller side pointcuts. I.e. the possibility to advise a
                            method invocation (caller side) apart from method
                            execution (callee side).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fine-grained pattern language for picking out pointcuts.
                            It is now possible to pick out method pointcuts by method name,
                            parameter types and return type as well as field pointcuts
                            by field name and field type. All these support regular
                            expressions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Runtime attributes for advices (method/field/throws).
                            I.e. add meta-data to your methods/field/classes as
                            JavaDoc tags which are picked up by the weaver and
                            used as rule set when doing the transformations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Class selectors for aspects. I.e. pick out classes using
                            regular expressions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Advising of static fields.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Parameters to advices. The possibility to pass
                            parameters to advices through the XML definition.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Advice stacks. The possibility to define stacks/chains
                            of advices that can be reused throughout the XML definition.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            MethodAdvice has been renamed to AroundAdvice and the
                            FieldAdvices has been renamed to PreAdvice and PostAdvice.

                            (in previous releases you could only add/remove/reorder
                            existing advices).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ant task for offline post-processing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
