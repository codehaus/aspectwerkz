                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Caller side pointcuts. I.e. the possibility to advise a
                            method invocation (caller side) apart from method
                            execution (callee side).
                        </li><br/>
                        <li>
                            Fine-grained pattern language for picking out pointcuts.
                            It is now possible to pick out method pointcuts by method name,
                            parameter types and return type as well as field pointcuts
                            by field name and field type. All these support regular
                            expressions.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li>
                            Runtime attributes for advices (method/field/throws).
                            I.e. add meta-data to your methods/field/classes as
                            JavaDoc tags which are picked up by the weaver and
                            used as rule set when doing the transformations.
                        </li><br/>
                        <li>
                            Class selectors for aspects. I.e. pick out classes using
                            regular expressions.
                        </li><br/>

                            Parameters to advices. The possibility to pass
                            parameters to advices through the XML definition.

                        <li>
                            Advice stacks. The possibility to define stacks/chains
                            of advices that can be reused throughout the XML definition.
                        </li><br/>
