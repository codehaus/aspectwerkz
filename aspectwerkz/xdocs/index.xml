                <p>
                    <code>AspectWerkz</code> is a dynamic, lightweight and
                    high-performant AOP/AOSD framework for Java.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>AspectWerkz</code> utilizes runtime bytecode
                    modification to weave your classes at runtime. It hooks in
                    and weaves classes loaded by any class loader except the
                    bootstrap class loader.

                    It has a rich join point model. Aspects, advices and
                    introductions are written in plain Java and your target
                    classes can be regular POJOs.

                    You have the possibility to add, remove and re-structure
                    advices as well as swapping the implementation of your
                    introductions at runtime.

                    Your aspects can be defined using either an XML definition
                    file or using Runtime Attributes.
                </p>
                <p>
                   <code>AspectWerkz</code> offers both power and simplicity
                    and will help you to easily integrate AOP in both new and
                    existing projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>AspectWerkz</code> is Free Software. The
                    <a href="/license.html">LGPL</a> license is
                    sufficiently flexible to allow the use of <code>AspectWerkz</code>
                    in both open source and commercial projects.
