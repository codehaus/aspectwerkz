                <p>
                    <code>AspectWerkz</code> is a dynamic, lightweight and
                    high-performant AOP/AOSD framework for Java.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>AspectWerkz</code> utilizes runtime bytecode
                    modification to weave your classes at runtime. It hooks in
                    and weaves classes loaded by any class loader except the
                    bootstrap class loader.

                    Aspects, advices and introductions are written in plain Java
                    and your target classes can be regular POJOs.

                    You have the possibility to add, remove and re-structure
                    advices as well as swapping the implementation of your
                    introductions at runtime.

                    Your aspects can be defined using either an XML definition
                    file or using Runtime Attributes.

                    It has a rich join point model and supports transparent
                    persistence for both advices and introductions.
                </p>
                <p>
                   <code>AspectWerkz</code> offers both power and simplicity
                    and will help you to easily integrate AOP in both new and
                    existing projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>AspectWerkz</code> is Free Software. The
                    <a href="/license.html">LGPL</a> license is
                    sufficiently flexible to allow the use of <code>AspectWerkz</code>
                    in both open source and commercial projects.
