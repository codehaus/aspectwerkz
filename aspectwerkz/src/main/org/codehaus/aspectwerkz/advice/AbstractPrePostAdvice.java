 * Abstract base class for the pre and post advice classes.
 * Is invoked after that a specific join point has been executed.
 * <p/>
 * Supports four different deployment models:
 *     PER_JVM, PER_CLASS, PER_INSTANCE and PER_THREAD.<br/>
 *
 * The PER_JVM deployment model performance a bit better than the other models
 * since no synchronization and object creation is needed.
