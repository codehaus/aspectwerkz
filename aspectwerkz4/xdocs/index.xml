            <subsection name="Simple, high-performant, dynamic, lightweight and powerful AOP for Java">
                <p>
                    <code>AspectWerkz</code> is a dynamic, lightweight and
                    high-performant AOP framework for Java.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>AspectWerkz</code> offers both power and simplicity
                    and will help you to easily integrate AOP in both new and
                    existing projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>AspectWerkz</code> utilizes bytecode
                    modification to weave your classes at project build-time, class load time or runtime. It hooks in
                    using standardized JVM level APIs.

                    It has a rich and highly orthogonal join point model. Aspects, advices and
                    introductions are written in plain Java and your target
                    classes can be regular POJOs.

                    You have the possibility to add, remove and re-structure
                    advice as well as swapping the implementation of your
                    introductions at runtime.
                                            
                    Your aspects can be defined using either Java 5 annotations,
                    Java 1.3/1.4 custom doclets or a simple XML definition
                    file.
