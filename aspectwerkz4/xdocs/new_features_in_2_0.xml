                        <code>PATH</code>.

            <p>
                The
                <code>AspectWerkz 2</code> architecture is a complete rewrite of the core weaver and container.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we where designing the new architecture we had four different objectives:
                <ul>
                    <b>
                        <li>Performance</li>
                    </b>
                    <p>
                        The AspectWerkz weaver is now completely based on static compilation (no reflection at all), which
                        means the the weaved code
                        <b>very</b> fast. We have released a simple microbenchmark that compares
                        AspectWerkz with all the other major AOP implementations.

                        The new container is very open and extensible. It allows plugging in different
                        <i>Aspect Model Extensions</i>
                        that allows running other AOP framework's aspect inside the
                        <i>AspectWerkz Extensible Aspect Container</i>.

                        at runtime. This implementation based on
                        <i>HotSwap</i> and garantuees that the performance
                        of the target application will be the same when an aspect has been undeployed as it was before
                        it was deployed (either hot-deployed or at startup time).

        <section name="AspectWerkz Extensible Aspect Container">
            <p>
                The last couple of years the Java AOP landscape has flourished. It has gone from one single implementation
                (AspectJ), to a whole bunch of frameworks, each one with its own way of defining and instantiating its aspects
                 and with its own weaver, runtime environment and tools. Even though having many ways of doing things is not
                 necessary a bad thing, especially not in such early days of a new technology, it is not making it easier for
                 new users of AOP and does not speed up its adoption.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you look at most frameworks out there you can see that they have a lot in common, most of them share same
                 semantics, life-cycle options etc. Most of them have re-implemented concepts introduced by AspectJ and in some
                 cases introduced their own.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is something that we have had in mind when we were designing the new AspectWerkz container and weaver and
                 led us to an open architecture that was easy to extend, an architecture that formed the foundation for the
                 AspectWerkz Extensible Aspect Container.
            </p>
            <p>
                Basically it allows you to plug in extensions that can handle the framework specific details, while the common
                 things are shared. What this brings you is a weaver and a container that can weave, deploy and run any aspect
                 no matter how it is implemented and defined.
            </p>
            <p>
                This introduces many advantages and opens for standardization on tools (development and runtime manageability).

                <code>AspectWerkz</code> supports both hot deployment and hot undeployment of aspects.
                It utilizes HotSwap (Java 1.4) or JVMTI (Java 5) to redefine your application at runtime.
                New aspects can be added to the running system and old ones can be redefined or removed at runtime.
            </p>

                <p>
                The use of deployment scopes give you more predictable and safer deployment.
                </p>
                <p>
                They are needed due to the fact that no JVMs today support schema redefinition when
                redefining your classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                This means that you have to define a special kind of pointcut that we call deployment scope,
                which will prepare you application and advise the points that you are interested in doing
                hot depoyment on later.
                </p>
                <p>
                You can then retrieve a handle to this deployment scope by getting
                the actual instance of the abstraction and then use this to narrow down the scope of
                the deployment so you are sure that you will not try to deploy the aspect at points in your
                code that will not be affected. Hence you are garantueed that your aspect will be deployed at
                valid points in your code.

                </p>
                <p>
                    You define the deployment scope just as regular pointcuts, in its own aspect or in the same
                    aspect as the rest of your code:
                    <source><![CDATA[
@Expression("execution(String *.toString())")
DeploymentScope toString;
                    ]]></source>

                </p>
                <p>
                    You can then retrieve the instance of the
                    <code>DeploymentScope</code> like this:
                    <source><![CDATA[
DeploymentScope scope = SystemDefinition.getDefinitionFor(loader, systemId).getDeploymentScope("toString");

                All
                    <code>deploy(..)</code> methods returns a
                    <code>DeploymentHandle</code> which is a handle to
                the specific deployment event. You can use this handle to revert the changes made by the deployment,
                In other words, it allows you to undeploy the aspect you deployed and be sure that it will be
                undeployed exactly the way it was deployed, same class loader, same deployment scope etc.
                </p>

                    You retrieve it from one of the

        <section name="Richer after advice semantics">
            <p>
                In previous releases of
                <code>AspectWerkz</code> we only supported one single type of
                <i>after advice</i>. The sematics of this type was that it was always executed, regardless
                of wheter an exception had been throw or if the method returned successfully.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the new 2.x architecture we have enhanced the semantics for this type of advice and have
                borrow the semantics from
                <code>AspectJ</code>. So now we support three different types
                of
                <i>after advice</i>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>@AfterFinally</code> (same as
                        <code>@After</code>)

                    <li>
                        <code>@AfterReturning [TYPE]</code> -
                        <code>@AfterReturing(pointcut)</code> or
                        <code>@AfterReturning(type=onReturnedType, pointcut=pointcut)</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>@AfterThrowing [TYPE]</code> -
                        <code>@AfterThrowing(pointcut)</code> or
                        <code>@AfterThrowing(type=onThrownedType, pointcut=pointcut))</code>
                    </li>

                    <code>after</code> advice declaration, you can use any syntax you like.

                <p>
                    <code>after finally</code> advice are always executed, they work the same as a finally block.
                    Meaning that they will be invoked regardless of wheter an exception has been thrown or if the

                Advice are methods in aspect class. The method signature must conform to some rules, depending on the pointcut
                where the advice is bound to, when args(..), this(..) and/or target(..) are used to gain access to join point
                argument / caller / callee instance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from this pointcut bounded arguments, the advice can have extra arguments of type "JoinPoint" or
                "StaticJoinPoint", which do not appear in the pointcut. First version of AspectWerkz were supporting only
                "JoinPoint" as advice argument, and use of "getRtti()" RTTI API was mandatory.
            </p>
            <p>
                In AspectWerkz 2.x, use of "StaticJoinPoint" and/or "JoinPoint" as advice argument is optional and use of
                it (or no use of it at all) depends on aspect developer decision. Note that for "around" advice, in order to
                invoke "proceed()" properly, you will need access to wether a "StaticJoinPoint" or "JoinPoint" instance).
            </p>
            <p>
                When only "StaticJoinPoint" is used, specific optimizations are used to maximize runtime performance
                since RTTI access is then guaranteed to not happen.

            <p>
                In AspectWerkz 2.x, the former "TypedAnnotationProxy" and "UntypedAnnotationProxy" classes are gone.
                To define a strongly typed custom annotation with Java 1.3/1.4, you need to write an interface.
                This interface should only have method whose return type is the annotation element type (see restriction below)
                and with no paramters. This means that Java 1.3/1.4 annotation are identical to Java 5 annotations
                except that the annotation is an "interface" and not a "@interface" (see samples below).
            </p>
            <p>
                If the annotation is exposing an anonymous element, the special "[type] value();" method should be used
                (as in Java 5 annotations)
            </p>
            <p>
                Restrictions: In Java 5, Annotations defined with "@interface" have restrictions. Type of exposed elements
                cannot be multi-dimensional arrays, etc. The same restriction applies for Java 1.3/1.4 AspectWerkz annotations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: Java 5 "default" value is not available in Java 1.3/1.4 AspectWerkz annotations, hence the default
                value of "non Java 5" annotation elements is "null" (or 0 / false for primitives types).
                <br/>
                Note: Java 5 does not support having several annotation of the same type on the same member, while this is
                possible with AspectWerkz 1.3/1.4 Annotations (though not recommanded for upward compatibility)
                <br/>
                Note: Java 1.3/1.4 annotation will implement both the given interface and the org...Annotation interface which
                is equivalent to the java.lang.annotation.Annotation interface (f.e. annotationType() will return the type of the
                annotation).
                <br/>
                Note: for Java 5, the annotation that appears in the source must be part of the imports or fully qualified
                (@foo.bar.AnnotateMe("some texte")). For AspectWerkz equivalent with 1.3/1.4, use the custom annotation.properties
                file at compilation time to set annotation nickname (f.e. @Hello("some text") could be of type foo.bar.AnnotateMe this way..)
            </p>

        <section name="New Mixin implementation">
            <p>
                We have replaced the old mixin implementation with a comletely new and better one.
                The new implementation mainly gives you two things you did not have before:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Serialization of the Mixins -
                        <br/>
                        The default behaviour is that the mixins will be serialized along with the target class.
                        But you have the option of making the mixins
                        <code>transient</code> (e.g. not serialized with
                        when the target class is serialized), by setting the
                        <code>transient=true</code> flag.
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                        Providing your own factory to control the instantiation of the mixin. This means that you
                        can plug in any IoC (dependency injection) framework to handle this for you. The custom
                        factories needs only to implement the
                        <code>org.codehaus.aspectwerkz.aspect.MixinFactory</code>
                        interface.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The mixins can be any regular class, which means that it can be a standalone class, an inner class
                of a regular class or an inner class in your aspect class.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two different
                <code>deployment models</code> are supported,
                <code>perClass</code> and
                <code>perInstance</code>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>perClass</code> - means that there will be one instance per mixin per
                        target class.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>perInstance</code> - means that there will be one instance per mixin per
                        target instance.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Note: the
                <code>perThread</code> deployment model has been left to die in peace. The
                <code>perJVM</code>
                deployment model is currently not supported but might come back.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are using the default factory implementation you have to either provide an no argument constructor
                or a constructor that takes the:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        target class as its only parameter - to be used with the
                        <code>perClass</code> deployment model.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        target instance as its only parameter - to be used with the
                        <code>perInstance</code> deployment model.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <subsection name="Annotation definition">
                <p>
                    To define the mixin using annotations you have to use the
                    <code>org.codehaus.aspectwerkz.annotation.Mixin</code> annotation.
                    If using Java 5 this is an annotation interface (e.g.
                    <code>@interface</code>) else
                    (for JavaDoc annotations) it is a regular interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This annotation has three different parameters:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>expression</code> (can be used as the default anonymous value) - the pointcut expression
                            that is used to pick out the set of classes to apply this mixin to.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>deploymentModel</code> (optional) - has to me one of
                            <code>perClass</code> or
                            <code>perInstance</code>. If not specified then
                            <code>perInstance</code> is used.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>isTransient</code> (optional) - defines the mixin as transient or not. If not
                            specified then the default is
                            <code>false</code>, e.g. serializable.
                        </li>

                <p>
                    The XML definition (in the
                    <code>META-INF/aop.xml</code> file) can be used for
                    three different purposes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Only to define which mixins should be used. Similar to how you declare which aspects
                            should be used.) This can be the option if the mixin is defined in annotations.
                            Then you only need to use the
                            <code>class</code> attribute, e.g.
                            <code>&lt;mixin class="foo.bar.MyMixinImpl"/&gt;</code>. See below for details.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            To override and/or resolve ad definition made using annotations.

                <p>
                    To define the mixin using the XML definition, use the
                    <code>mixin</code> element. It has
                    five different attributes that can be used:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <code>class</code> (mandatory) - defines which class to use as the implementation class.
                            Has to be the fully qualified name of the class.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>deployment-model</code> (optional) - defines the deployment model. Can be one of
                            <code>perClass</code> of
                            <code>perInstance</code>.

                        <li>
                            <code>transient</code> (optional) - defines the mixin as
